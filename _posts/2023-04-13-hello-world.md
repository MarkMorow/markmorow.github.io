It's a rule all technical blogs start with this post. You can read the home page for a bit more [about me](/), which I'll keep up to date.

But just getting this up and running has helped me improve my Git, GitHub, and Markdown skills. You'll know they've really improved when I don't have to make several other pull requests to fix mistakes here.

Now that the easy part is done, anyone can start a site with a blog; the real trick is keeping it going. I hope to post, at a minimum, what I'm learning.

For things related to Azure AD, you can and should read the official blog for [Azure AD posts](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/bg-p/Identity).

Please leave a comment on what you are learning (this will help me make sure comments are actually working)!
