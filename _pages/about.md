Hi folks, I'm Mark Morowczynski, a principal product manager in the Microsoft Security Customer Experience Engineering (CxE) team. I work with customers on their deployments of Microsoft Entra ID/Azure AD and take the learnings and feedback from those deployments to work it back into the product to make things better and more accessible for all customers.

I'll be using this site for a few things:

1. I'm building up several skills outside my identity work. Things such as collaborating via Git, GitHub, and Markdown are not something I do day to day. This site will help with that.
2. I'd like to spend more time developing skills in security research, specifically on the Apple platforms and ARM.
3. I plan on blogging about what I've learned.
4. I want a central location for presentations and posts. You can see that in the 'created content' section.

You can and should read the official blog for [Microsoft Entra ID/Azure AD posts](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/bg-p/Identity).

Outside the technology space I enjoy reading and watching baseball, hockey and basketball.
